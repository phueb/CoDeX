# CoDeX

Co-occurrence Decomposition Explorer

## About

This repository contains code that launches a simple interactive app for exploring how properties of a co-occurrence matrix change under various transformations.

Properties investigated are: 
- information theoretic decomposition: H(X|Y) and H(Y|X)
- singular value decomposition: variance explained by first singular value 

## Usage

To run the app,

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Compatibility

Developed on Ubuntu 18.04 and Python 3.7
