# CoDeX

Co-occurrence Decomposition Explorer

This repository contains code that launches a simple interactive app for exploring how properties of a co-occurrence matrix change under various transformations.

Properties investigated are: 
- information theoretic decompositon: H(X|Y) and H(Y|X)
- singular value decomposition: variance explained by first singular value
